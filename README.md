# Book Library

### Cognifide Java Intern Project
This is a book library managment platform. Application enable libraries to share informations about their book collections with customers. I created 3 endpoints which serve the relevant informaton based on data read from JSON file. 
## Getting Started
Spring Boot application, works on localhost, port 8080. There are 3 points, which returns:
-book identified by the given ISBN number, or id if field isbn13 doesnt exist,
-list of all books that are assigned to the requested category,
-Lists all authors and their rating.
Project was written in Intellij Idea.
