# Book Library

### Cognifide Java Intern Project
This is a book library managment platform. Application enable libraries to share informations about their book collections with customers. I created 3 endpoints which serve the relevant informaton based on data read from JSON file. 
## Getting Started
Spring Boot application, works on localhost, port 8080. There are 3 points, which returns:
* book identified by the given ISBN number, or id if field isbn13 doesnt exist,
* list of all books that are assigned to the requested category,
* Lists all authors and their rating.

Project was written in Intellij Idea.
To generate Java objects from json i used [jsonschema2pojo](https://github.com/joelittlejohn/jsonschema2pojo/), so there are some additional classes i wasn't working with.
Main methods are placed in the classes described below:
LibraryClient.java- rest controller,
GetJson.java- reading .json files,
VolumeInfo.java- contains most object, that are serialized,
ControllerMethods.java- contains methods used by rest controller.
Other classes were generated by jsonschema2pojo and they have not been changed. 

## Run Project
#### Clone Repository

At first clone repository

### Build Project

### Running
After building the application run following command to start it:
```
./gradlew run
```
## How to use
First when you turn on application, write path to your command line 
e.g.
```
C:\Program Files\books.json
```
You can use books.json which is included in the application.
```
books.json
```
After that you can use application in your browser.
To get book with isbn number, put this address into browser:

```
http://localhost:8080/isbn/9781592432172
```
"9781592432172" number can be replacew with book isbn13 number, or book id when doesn't have isbn13. 

To get book with isbn number, put this address into browser:

```
http://localhost:8080/category/Computers  
```
Category "Computers" you can replace with another category.

To get author rating, put this address into browser:

```
http://localhost:8080/rating 
```
## Running the tests
I used Junit 4 for tests.

To run the automated tests:
```
./gradlew test
```
